# AEN: Generative Music Algorithm

Please check out the [story behind the project, and the music it can create](http://vel9.com/aen/aen.html).

This project is always being updated as I work on more and more pieces with it, so make sure to check back in

To start generating music, you need:
1. Gradle-based Java development environment
2. Receiver that can translate the MIDI signals transmitted by AEN into sound. Your system could be able to render the signals out-of-the-box, using its built-in MIDI synthesizer, but I would recommend using something like Ableton Live where you'd have a lot of control over the receiver instruments. Here's a [guide](https://help.ableton.com/hc/en-us/articles/209774225-Using-virtual-MIDI-buses-in-Live) for how I set up Ableton Live as the Receiver for the MIDI signals.
